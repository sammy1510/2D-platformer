Here is the first proper game I tried completing within a certain time frame for a school coursework, admittedly few elements need work but this is it for now 

Few things which are incomplete
- Game recognising that the level is complete
- Therefore, all levels are unlocked
- Not possible to choose the middle character in 'choose characters' option in the menu
